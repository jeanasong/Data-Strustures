Graphs
Get started with graphs!

The last type of data structure you are going to look at is graphs. 
Graphs are used to represent data points, or vertices, that are connected by edges. 
Common applications for graphs are things like maps, where each location is a vertex, and each path, or road, between the locations is an edge. 
Graphs can be directed (a one-way street) or undirected (a two-way street), as well as weighted or unweighted (think of the length of each street as a potential measurement of weight).
