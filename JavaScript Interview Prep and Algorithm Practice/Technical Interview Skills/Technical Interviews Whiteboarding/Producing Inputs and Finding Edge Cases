TECHNICAL INTERVIEWS: WHITEBOARDING
Producing Inputs and Finding Edge Cases
When the question is clear, we then produce concrete inputs and outputs. These inputs guide a solution for the remainder of the interview so write them on the board!

You may still be unclear how to solve the problem in code, but it’s certain that given an input, X, your function will produce an output, Y.

Make one input the happy path: input that reflects a common scenario.

For example, you’re asked to write a function which capitalizes the first letter of an input string.

A good input could be "apple", which returns "Apple" because this demonstrates the function’s purpose.

If the input were "Apple", it would return "Apple". That’s correct but less informative.

Also think about edge cases, or inputs which do not reflect a common scenario and may cause problems.

For the capitalization function, what should you return if given None as input? Or a number?

Instructions
Write inputs and outputs for the Pythagorean Triplet problem.

Try to give yourself a few different cases.



Technical Interview Input-Output Edge Cases
The second step after problem clarification in a technical interview is to define acceptable inputs and expected outputs to the solution as well as identify edge cases that will stretch the solution to its limits. 
The ability to foresee potential setbacks and bound the problem adds merit to the interviewee’s credit.
