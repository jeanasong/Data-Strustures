TECHNICAL INTERVIEWS: WHITEBOARDING
Testing with Inputs
With a working implementation on the whiteboard, use the test inputs to walk through the evaluation of your code.

Write out any temporary variables on the board and update them when they change during execution.

This is another opportunity to showcase your communication skills, and will help you catch any logical errors which you may not have noticed in earlier steps.

If you catch an error, don’t panic! Mistakes happen. Explain the issue and talk through what you can do to fix the bug.

Your interviewer may want to see you write the correction or they may be satisfied with the explanation.

Instructions
Use your test inputs and implementation to talk through your solution.

Again, say each line aloud so you become more comfortable speaking about the code you’ve written.

Track the variables used and update them as you go.



Technical Interview Solution Testing
In step five of the technical interview process, after the solution has been coded on the whiteboard, it’s time to test the solution with the clearly defined inputs from step two and verify the expected outputs. 
Walk through each line of code with your interviewer, identify and correct any logical error found, if possible.
