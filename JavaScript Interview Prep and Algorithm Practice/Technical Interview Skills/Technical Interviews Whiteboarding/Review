TECHNICAL INTERVIEWS: WHITEBOARDING
Review
Technical interviews judge the candidateâ€™s ability to perform technical aspects of the job. 
Whiteboarding is a type of technical interview which requires the candidate to code a solution without the assistance of a text editor.

Coding an efficient solution is important, but the ultimate goal as an interviewee is to convince the interviewer you would be a desirable co-worker.

A desirable co-worker is able to articulate their thought process and collaborate without friction.

Our whiteboarding strategies revolve around communication at every step.

The steps are:

Clarify the Problem
Create Inputs
Outline the Solution
Code the Solution
Test the Solution
Analyze the Solution
Instructions
Practice makes perfect!

Run through these steps with a new practice problem:

Write a function which prints every number from 0 up to the given input. 
If divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
If divisible by 5, print "Buzz". 
If input is divisible by 3 AND 5, print "FizzBuzz".
