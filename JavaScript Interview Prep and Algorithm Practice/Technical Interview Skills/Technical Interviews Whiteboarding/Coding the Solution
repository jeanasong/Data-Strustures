TECHNICAL INTERVIEWS: WHITEBOARDING
Coding the Solution
We’ve finally come to the portion where you’ll write some code! Previous steps improve your odds for success because you have an outline and clear inputs for testing.

Writing code on the board is a collaborative process. Refer to your outline and explain the step you’re implementing.

The goal is to be facing the interviewer when talking through the implementation and facing the board when you’re writing the code.

Try to avoid writing code in silence or narrating at a low level like “for… i… in… range… length of the list… colon” when writing for i in range(len(input_list)):.

When you’re finished with the implementation, look it over for any mistaken syntax or logical errors.

Instructions
Code the solution to the Pythagorean Triplets problem by writing it out on paper. Use your outline from the previous exercise as a guide.

Before writing each step on paper, say what you will do out loud. Better to practice by yourself than in a real interview!



Technical Interview Solution Whiteboarding
The fourth step in the technical interview process is to whiteboard your solution after you have previously outlined it. 
Make this step as collaborative as possible by explaining to the interviewer the code you are about to write before writing it on the board. 
Repeat this process for each outlined step in your solution. Face your interviewer when speaking and face the board when coding.
