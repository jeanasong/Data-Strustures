/*MinHeap Class
Our MinHeap class will store two pieces of information:

An array of elements within the heap.
A count of the elements within the heap.
To make our lives easier, weâ€™ll always keep one element at the beginning of the array with the value null. By doing this, we can simplify our coding by always referencing our minimum element at index 1 instead of 0 and our last element at index this.size instead of this.size - 1.

const minHeap = new MinHeap();
console.log(minHeap.heap);
// [ null ]
console.log(minHeap.size);
// 0 */

class MinHeap {
    constructor() { // Within MinHeap.js, define the MinHeap class constructor with no parameter. Inside the constructor:
      this.heap = [null]; // define a heap property as an array containing null
      this.size = 0; // define a size property instantiated to 0
    }
  
  }
  module.exports = MinHeap;
